This file is placeholder for the dataset.

We are not publicly uploading this dataset but you can place it here under directory named `raw` with subdirectories: `Train`, `Test`, and `Validate`.

Also if working with openface, the aligned images and feature are stored in directories `aligned` and `openface-features` respectively.
Each directory has the same subdirectory structure of `Train`, `Test`, and `Validate`.
