# Detecting-dysmorphic-facial-signs-for-medical-diagnosis
In this project we developed several classifiers to detect dsymorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis. Our goal is to develop a robust classifier that can discern between twelve commonly occurring syndromes: 22q11, Angelman, Apert, CDL, Down, FragileX, Marfan, Progeria, Sotos, TreacherCollins, Turner, and Williams. Our project can be broken down into three methods: facial-keypoint based classifiers, OpenFace feature vector based classifiers, and a VGGFace transfer learning classifier. We will discuss each section below regarding setup, dependencies, and execution.
